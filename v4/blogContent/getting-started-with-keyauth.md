Welcome to KeyAuth! This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with KeyAuth and integrate it into your application.

## What is KeyAuth?

KeyAuth is a powerful cloud-based authentication system designed to protect your software from piracy and unauthorized access. With KeyAuth, you can implement secure licensing, user management, and subscription systems in minutes.

## Why Choose KeyAuth?

- **Easy Integration:** Get up and running in less than 5 minutes with our simple API
- **Robust Security:** Military-grade encryption protects your software and user data
- **Flexible Licensing:** Support for subscriptions, lifetime licenses, and trial periods
- **Real-time Analytics:** Monitor your application usage and user activity
- **Multi-platform Support:** Works with C++, C#, Python, Java, and more

## Step 1: Create Your Account

First, head over to [keyauth.cc/register](https://keyauth.cc/register) and create your free account. You'll get instant access to the dashboard where you can create your first application.

## Step 2: Create an Application

Once logged in, navigate to the dashboard and click "Create Application". Fill in your application details:

- Application Name
- Application Description

## Step 3: Integrate the SDK

KeyAuth provides SDKs for multiple programming languages. Here's a quick example in C#:

```csharp
using KeyAuth;

public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var KeyAuthApp = new api(
            name: "YourAppName",
            ownerid: "YourOwnerID",
            version: "1.0"
        );
        
        KeyAuthApp.init();
        
        if (!KeyAuthApp.response.success)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Failed to initialize!");
            return;
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Successfully initialized!");
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Implement User Authentication

Now that you've initialized KeyAuth, you can implement user login:

```csharp
Console.Write("Enter username: ");
string username = Console.ReadLine();

Console.Write("Enter password: ");
string password = Console.ReadLine();

Console.Write("Enter Two-Factor Code: ");
string twofaCode = Console.ReadLine();

KeyAuthApp.login(username, password, twofaCode);

if (KeyAuthApp.response.success)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Successfully logged in!");
    Console.WriteLine($"Welcome, {KeyAuthApp.user_data.username}!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Login failed: {KeyAuthApp.response.message}");
}
```

## Step 5: Add License Validation

Protect your software with license key validation:

```csharp
Console.Write("Enter license key: ");
string licenseKey = Console.ReadLine();

Console.Write("Enter Two-Factor Code: ");
string twofaCode = Console.ReadLine()

KeyAuthApp.license(licenseKey, twofaCode);

if (KeyAuthApp.response.success)
{
    Console.WriteLine("License valid!");
    // Continue with your application
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Invalid license!");
    Environment.Exit(0);
}
```

## Advanced Features

### User Variables

Store custom data for each user:

```csharp
// Set a user variable
KeyAuthApp.setvar("coins", "100");

// Get a user variable
string coins = KeyAuthApp.getvar("coins");
```

### Webhooks

Execute server-side code securely:

```csharp
string response = KeyAuthApp.webhook("webhookId", "&param=value");
Console.WriteLine(response);
```

## Best Practices

> Always store your application credentials securely. Never hardcode them in plain text or commit them to public repositories.

- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep your SDK updated to the latest version
- Enable two-factor authentication for your KeyAuth account
- Regularly monitor your application logs
