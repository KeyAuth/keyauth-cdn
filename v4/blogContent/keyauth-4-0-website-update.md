Welcome to KeyAuth's 1.4 Website Update! This update includes a new dashboard, which is much more user-friendly and easier to use than the previous one. The new dashboard also has many other features that make it even better.

## Overview
The new dashboard is designed with simplicity in mind. It has a clean layout and easy-to-use interface that makes it simple for users to navigate through different sections of the website. Additionally, the dashboard has added several new features such as improved search functionality, enhanced security measures, and more customization options.

- **Users**: We've decreased the number of users you can have from unlimited to 10,000
- **Event Logs**: We've decreased the number of event logs you can store from unlimited to 50,000. 

**Want Unlimited Logs?** 
If you would like to store unlimited logs, please send all of your logs to Discord or Telegram by heading over to [settings](https://keyauth.cc/app/?page=settings) and setting the webhook link to the channel where you would like your logs sent to.
